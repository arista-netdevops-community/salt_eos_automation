For example, to start the salt proxy minion the salt proxy minion has to know the switch it needs to proxy to as well as a username/password. reactors Reactors are exactly what they sound like. Anything which is sent back and forth within the salt ZeroMQ bus you can react to. So for example, salt often includes Key value pairs within the ZeroMQ bus. You can key off of anything you want and send the data to a external system. So if you have a switch which is provsioning you can then react on that to tell a external system say slack to tell the channel the switch is currently provisioning. states States are exactly what they sound like. A state is the state of a given salt minion. For example, a state might be a one time configuration to configure a server for things like apache and mysql. In our lab there is a state to render configuration and a state to then push the configuration. States are a deterministic way to push a state to a salt minion. templates Templates hold templates of certain devices. In all of our examples templates hold the jinja2 templates for each of the configurations. .sls extensions Salt uses the .sls extension whithin any salt file. So for example, any of the state files will end with a .sls for example /srv/salt/states/push_vlans.sls which is a state module to push vlans to a device with the pyeapi module .

Salt native minion - This is a minion install on the switch operating system itself in the form of a extension just like a linux server. Salt proxy minion - This is a service which will run either on the master or somewhere externally which will proxy for example, all api request to the switch back to the master and over the ZeroMQ bus. The reasoning for this is a lot of people do not like to run the actual salt minion on the network OS. If you recall all the minions work in a master/minion style of functionality. So the minion will start up discover the salt master and the master then has to accept the key from the minon. Salt discovery Upon a salt minion being installed it needs to find the salt master. The default way is having a dns lookup for the hostname of salt this is also configurable within the minion config file under /etc/salt/minion #/etc/salt/minion master: 1.2.3.4 The salt minion will then try to negotiate a secure connection to 1.2.3.4 once the connection is made the salt master will have to accept the connection. This can either be manual or automatic. The good part about salt versus other configuration management platforms is that salt does not require a username/password. In this example the salt minion is brought online. Once online it has to find its master. In a manual mode the master issues a 'salt-key -L' which will scan for new nodes. The 'salt-key -A' command will accept all new minion nodes. Salt native minion A salt native minion is the typical way of installing a linux minion that will sit on the device and communicate with the underlying host itself and send the data back to the master. At the time of writing this the native minion is almost GA and will be out at any point. Right now the minion will use either pyeapi or napalm to configure the device. Salt native minion Running the lab we typically start with salt-proxy --proxyid=base_lab_Leaf1 -d what this does is run a proxy process using the proxyid of base_lab_leaf1 salt-proxy itself will read the /srv/salt/pillars/top.sls file and find the proxies in which it needs to match base_lab_leaf1 for the proxy info. #/srv/salt/pillar/top.sls base: base_lab_Spine1: - base_lab_Spine1 base_lab_Spine2: - base_lab_Spine2 base_lab_Leaf1: - base_lab_Leaf1 base_lab_Leaf2: - base_lab_Leaf2 #base_lab_Leaf1.sls proxy: proxytype: napalm driver: eos host: base_lab_Leaf1 username: arista password: arista pyeapi: username: arista password: arista transport: http The top file will command the proxy to pickup the pillars for base_lab_Leaf1.sls which allows the execution modules of both proxy modules for pyeapi and napalm.

Salt is a event drivien automation platform. This is different than the conventional network automation configuration platform tool as salt is able to not only generate configurations or automate certain software. Salt is also able to react to events with its ZeroMQ messaging system which sends constant events from the salt master to the salt minions. Salt was created in 2011 to stop a lot of manual work on servers. So a person would typically log into a linux server and apply application configuration to a device manually. Obviously, like network devices doing everything by hand is extremely time consuming. Salt started off as a configuration management only simply having a agent on each of the linux machines which then talked back to the master. Salt is written in 100% python which is extremely nice because a lot of salt can be modified to the users needs. Salt supports many different templating languages the most popular is Jinja. The general idea of salt is that everything is done within the master node(s). The master like the name suggests controls the minions. The master does remote execution which means it will send data to run through the minion to be remotely executed. In the state of the minion agent EOS opens up a unix socket which the device talks back to itself upon. Salt can be installed within a few minutes within this link . Common questions Salt vs Saltstack. Salt is the open source version of saltstack open for any developement. What ports need to be open for the salt master and salt minions to talk? UCP/TCP port 4505 and 4506. How is this differnt than Ansible, Chef and Puppet? Salt accomplishes the same thing as the other popular configuration management tools ie it will apply configuration, render templates etc. However, what is extremely unique to salt is that it has a modern ZeroMQ bus between minions and master node(s). So anything that happens within the salt minion is sent to the salt master as a sort of event. These events can even be sent externally to logging systems or salt can react to events that happen over the network bus. The idea is that instead of a human constantly creating playbooks or making changes the system operates autonomously. Salt like other configuration management systems has 3rd party integration into devices other than networking devices ie VMware, AWS etc. How does the minion talk to the master? With the salt agent the minion will talk to the salt master over the ZeroMQ bus over TCP ports 4506. The interesting part of the way salt works is that since it is a secure connection that the master has to accept there is no username/password that is required for the salt agent to talk to the master. This also means every time a device is brought online the master has to accept it. This can be automated but also allows for a secure connection instead of a constant api connection where a username and password are needed. What is the network driver within salt? One of the many advantages of saltstack is that it can communicate to the minions through the ZeroMQ bus in a datastructure in which it understands. In that datastructure the master simply passes data in the bus instructing the minion to use a module which is installed on the minion and pass data into it. The drivers that are commonly used are Napalm or net module and pyeapi","title":"Purpose of this repo"},{"location":"salt-general/#common-questions","text":"","title":"Common questions"},{"location":"salt-general/#salt-vs-saltstack","text":"Salt is the open source version of saltstack open for any developement.","title":"Salt vs Saltstack."},{"location":"salt-general/#what-ports-need-to-be-open-for-the-salt-master-and-salt-minions-to-talk","text":"UCP/TCP port 4505 and 4506.","title":"What ports need to be open for the salt master and salt minions to talk?"},{"location":"salt-general/#how-is-this-differnt-than-ansible-chef-and-puppet","text":"Salt accomplishes the same thing as the other popular configuration management tools ie it will apply configuration, render templates etc. However, what is extremely unique to salt is that it has a modern ZeroMQ bus between minions and master node(s).

For example, network switches that cannot run a minion or VMware ESXi that cannot run a linux process for the minion directly within the hypervisor.

That being said the salt super proxy was born(sproxy). The idea behind the sproxy is that it will not always run in a different location or on the master consuming memory.

So for example if we run the state salt 'leaf1' state.sls basic_bgp_render this will then output the file to /srv/salt/templates/intended/configs/leaf1 - source: /srv/salt/templates/basic_bgp.j2 - This is the source of the bgp template we are rendering. - template: jinja - use the jinja2 templating engine. Running the sale state To run any salt state the state.sls execution module has to be ran. Note do not include the .sls extension when running basic_bgp_render also, if you put a file directory called bgp within the states file you must call bgp.basic_bgp_render as salt uses python dotted notation. salt 'base_lab_Leaf1' state.sls basic_bgp_render base_lab_Leaf1: ---------- ID: render the output Function: file.managed Name: /srv/salt/templates/intended/configs/base_lab_Leaf1.cfg Result: True Comment: File /srv/salt/templates/intended/configs/base_lab_Leaf1.cfg is in the correct state Started: 14:59:30.537848 Duration: 361.574 ms Changes: Summary for base_lab_Leaf1 ------------ Succeeded: 1 Failed: 0 ------------ Total states run: 1 Total run time: 361.574 ms","title":"States"},{"location":"states/#running-the-sale-state","text":"To run any salt state the state.sls execution module has to be ran.
